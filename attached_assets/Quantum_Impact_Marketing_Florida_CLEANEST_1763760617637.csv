When proper posture and movement is restored, healing can occur without the use of drugs or surgery. The results can be astounding and life change.
I developed a tremendous respect for and fascination with the body's ability to heal itself after I saw a Chiropractor at age 17. I went on to study Chiropractic at Life University in 1982, receiving a Doctor of Chiropractic degree and graduating in March 1986.
Since receiving this degree, I have spent countless weekends traveling the country and attending seminars in post-graduate training. Focusing on functional medicine, nutrition, extremity adjustments, postural and exercise rehabilitation, the latest spinal research, new techniques and the treatment of children and pregnant patients.
I am an active member of the Florida Chiropractic Association (FCA), the Florida Chiropractic Society(FCS) the Broward County Chiropractic Society (BCCS), the Institute of Functional Medicine and Functional Medicine University.Experience.

He used to have debilitating migraines and trouble sleeping, but that all changed once he saw a chiropractor for the first time. After the first adjustment, he began to sleep better, and his migraines went away. It was at this moment that he realized his passion was to provide this same healing relief to the community. He studied at Palmer College of Chiropractic in Daytona Beach, Florida, where he earned his degree in Chiropractic. During this time, he learned about many techniques, most notably, those associated with upper cervical care. He found these to be the most precise, results-driven method of treatment to share with his patients. Best of all, this approach required no twisting of the head or cracking of the spine. He specializes in treating: Sciatica Whiplash Fibromyalgia Lower-back pain TMJ Scoliosis Headaches Dr. Elan is a lifelong learner who dedicates himself to staying abreast with the latest techniques in both chiropractic and upper cervical care.

As a consultant, he was exposed to how healthcare systems approached sickness and did not understand how so many fell into bad health. Identifying that current health protocol only prolonged the inevitable heath crisis that so many patients quickly approached he wondered what education was being provided to patients to prevent disease. He was fortunate enough to start working with chiropractors at conferences where he discovered their unique and inspiring way of treating illness and more importantly the prevention of illness. He quickly sought care for himself and his family. He fell in love with the art, science, and philosophy of chiropractic.

After seeing multiple doctors for his injury, it seemed the only option was rotator cuff surgery.  Desperate for an alternative, he sought out his chiropractor who had provided holistic care for his entire family. After a thorough examination his chiropractor offered this simple and reassuring suggestion, ""Give me six weeks, worst case scenario is you don't get better and you have surgery.""  Reassured and trusting of his doctors prescribed care, he began therapy.  After the first treatment there was a noticeable decrease in pain levels.  After two weeks of consistent treatment, Dr. P was able to throw lightly.  Four weeks after that, he returned to baseball full-time, pain free, and throwing harder than he had before the injury occurred.  This inspired a passion and sparked a desire for Dr. P to pursue a career in Chiropractic Medicine.
Dr. P began his journey toward helping others as a personal trainer at age 18.  Over the 10 plus years in the fitness industry he earned multiple advanced level training certifications in the areas of fitness and nutrition to better serve his clientele.  He attended the University of Bridgeport College of Chiropractic where he earned his Doctorate of Chiropractic.  Dr. P is a Board Certified Chiropractic Physician in the state of Florida.  Since graduation he has continued to advance his knowledge and understanding of the human body and physical medicine through multiple post-doctoral education and technique specific certifications.  These courses include Graston Technique Level 1, Functional and Kinetic Treatment with Rehab (FAKTR), RockTape Functional Movement Therapy Level 1 and 2, multiple Kinesotape application courses, and McKenzie's Mechanical Diagnosis and Therapy (MDT).

First trained as an ophthalmologist, she is fellowship trained in Oculoplastic Surgery, which is cosmetic and reconstructive eyelid surgery.
""I can vividly remember the day I discovered oculoplastic surgery as the focus of my career in medicine. I had already decided to pursue ophthalmology as my medical specialty, and I was spending a month at Wills Eye Hospital. My 'ah-ha' moment came when watching my future mentor, Dr. Joseph Flanagan, reconstruct an eyelid. Right then I knew that oculoplastics offered me the perfect combination of a challenging surgical specialty that also appealed to my creative and artistic side. To this day, I feel fortunate to have a satisfying career that I thoroughly enjoy.""
Her many patients who have been coming to her for as long as 20 years and have become friends over the years describe her as: ""Warm, friendly, poised and elegant"". Their loyalty to her for her exact techniques and the beautiful results she provides have allowed them to age gracefully without looking odd or over done.
Eight Things to Know About Dr. Andrea Hass (Dr. A)
1. Dr A studied bioengineering at the University of Pennsylvania because she enjoyed the problem solving approach to learning. Cosmetic eyelid, brow lift surgeries and facial injectables are similarly problem focused.
2. Internship near her sister in Connecticut became her own ""Grey's Anatomy"" when she met her husband, Dr. Brian Hass.
3. Oculoplastic Surgery (specialized plastic surgery of the eyes) is so unique and competitive, only about 30 doctors are trained each year.
4. Dr A performs about 25 times the number of eyelid surgeries as the typical busy cosmetic plastic surgeon.
5. Dr A is known for being thorough and patient during consults as well as thoughtful and precise in the OR. She keeps up with the latest in cosmetic practices and has always been committed to learning new skills and only bringing the best options to the practice. If she wouldn't have a procedure done to herself, family or staff, she won't offer it to her patients.
6. Both patients and other doctors acknowledge that she is among the best at what she does. In fact, other plastic surgeons send her their challenging eyelid cases to perform. These factors are tops among reasons why she has long been the ""go to"" person for cosmetic eyelid surgery as well as facial injectables.
7. Dr A is in the top 1% of the busiest injectors for both Botox and facial fillers. This is a result of nearly 20 years as an injector as well as her beautiful results.
8. Through her team effort with Dr Brian Hass for facelifts, her patients get the best of both worlds to meet their cosmetic needs in a warm, natural, consistent and caring fashion. In fact, if someone in the Palm Beach area isn't already her patient, in all likelihood, they have friends who are.",124 km,False,False,0

He completed his postdoctoral residency training in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery along with an additional year of General Surgery at the University of Miami/ Jackson Memorial Hospital in 2003. Since then he also completed a fellowship in Head and Neck Tumor and Reconstructive Surgery under the mentorship of Dr. Robert E. Marx at the University of Miami in 2005.
He served as Assistant Professor of Clinical Surgery in the University of Miami School of Medicine Division of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery in Miami, FL from 2005 to 2006 and was in private practice from 2006 to 2012 upon his full time return to the University of Miami School of Medicine Division of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery.
He served as Associate Professor in the University of Miami School of Medicine Division of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery from 5/2012 to 10/2014 and remains as adjunct faculty at the University of Florida College of Dentistry Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery since 7/2010. He has now returned to the full time private practice of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery.
Dr. Broumand spent 2 years in private practice in Boca Raton, FL and 4 years in Daytona Beach, FL from 2005 to 2011 and regularly participates in medical rescue missions and relief efforts. While in private practice he was also involved in extensive repair of craniofacial congenital and acquired deformities of adults and children through several non-profit foundations â€œMission Rescateâ€ and â€œOperation Changing Livesâ€ in the Dominican Republic and Haiti and other medically underserved areas.
After the devastating earthquake in Haiti in January 2010, Dr. Broumand closed his private practice on 2 occasions and chartered a private plane to the Dominican Republic and put together a group of 8 doctors for immediate emergency relief. Once in the DR they were forced to drive 12 hours to Port Au Prince from Santa Domingo along rough terrain. While in Haiti, Dr Broumand and his group worked out of the University of Miami tent hospital constructed by Project Medishare to provide relief effort.
Since the devastating earthquakes he has led two mission trips to Port Au Prince in 2010 and 2011, and in 2010 he was able to bring a young lady with a large Ossifying Fibroma of 15 years duration from Haiti to Daytona Beach, FL for medical and surgical treatment. He was able to fund her entire travel and stay in the USA through his foundation, and Halifax Medical Center generously funded her entire surgery and hospital stay in exchange for the 50 years of service that his partners Dr.â€™s Phillip Fleuchaus and Richard Gaines had given the community.
The Patient, Ms. Lorrette Pierre, underwent surgical and dental rehabilitation and returned to Haiti, he was able to see her during one of his yearly visits to the DR in which he accompanies dental students from the University of FL teaching them exodontia and oral surgery in rural areas in the DR.
He devotes most of his clinical practice to comprehensive treatment of trauma and tumor related facial reconstructive surgery, as well as surgical correction of TMJ disorders and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and orthognathic surgical correction of craniofacial deformities and placement of all-on-four and zygomatic dental implants and is also involved in extensive clinical research involving Bisphosphonate Induced Osteonecrosis of the Jaws (BIONJ).",74 km,False,False,0

Sharon McQuillan, MD is a board-certified physician specializing in integrative, regenerative, and aesthetic medicine. She graduated from The Ohio State University School of Medicine and is a member of Alpha Omega Alpha Medical Honors Society. As a board-certified family practitioner, she focused on preventive medicine, diet and exercise, bio-identical hormone replacement, and the mind-body connection long before integrative medicine was mainstream. As a practicing physician, she quickly realized that a healthy self-image is a critical component of optimal health and was one of the first physicians to offer the full spectrum of health, wellness, and cosmetic procedures in her practice.
After over twenty years of success in Central Ohio, Dr. McQuillan relocated her practice to Florida, where she further intensified her commitment to individualized medicine by incorporating the healing power of a patient's own stem cells to treat various degenerative conditions. In conjunction with an international team of experts, she has authored over twenty clinical studies utilizing autologous stem cells to treat many common ailments.
Dr. McQuillan's passion for teaching, standardization, and superior patient outcomes led her to the formation of Ageless Health, a hands-on training company for medical professionals. Dr. McQuillan has educated thousands of her colleagues in the art and science of integrative, regenerative, and aesthetic medicine.
Some of Dr. McQuillan's prestigious titles include Medical Director of both the Aesthetic and Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine Fellowships for the American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine.

She has appeared on Telemundo and Good Morning America and has made numerous local television appearances.

Dr. Sarraga decided at a very early age to follow in his grandfather's footsteps and pursue a career in the art of medicine and surgery. Even before entering medical school, Dr. Sarraga was fascinated by surgery; he spent all his summers volunteering in the operating room at the Cardiovascular Center in Puerto Rico. After completing his undergraduate studies in Chicago, he attended medical school at the University of Puerto Rico, where he received many awards including membership in the prestigious Alpha Omega Alpha honor society and being in the top 10 percent of his class.
Dr. Sarraga then completed a full general surgery residency at the University of Puerto Rico, where he was recognized as intern of the year during his internship year. While training at the oncologic hospital, he was first exposed to breast reconstruction. Soon after he decided that plastic surgery was his calling. Dr. Sarraga felt that restoring a woman's sense of self after she had undergone a mastectomy operation by reconstructing her breasts was a vitally important part of her eventual complete ""cure"" and recovery process. During his last year, he was chosen among his peers as Administrative Chief Resident and soon afterwards became Board Certified in General Surgery.
Dr. Sarraga then went North to complete his plastic surgery residency at the prestigious University of Massachusetts in New England. During his last year of training he was again recognized as Administrative Chief Resident amongst his peers. During his plastic surgery residency, Dr. Sarraga trained with the top aesthetic plastic surgeons in Boston learning the most up to date techniques in Facial plastic surgery, rhinoplasty, body contouring and fat grafting.
Dr. Sarraga then became interested on the healing and reconstructive properties of human fat cells, and decided to pursue some extra training with experts in the developing field of fat grafting and fat transfers This included Dr. Daniel Delvecchio. Stemming from this interest, Dr. Sarraga did additional clinical research on fat grafting for reconstruction of the breast, a topic that he has presented several papers on at international meetings. After completing his residency Dr. Sarraga was nominated as Assistant Professor of Surgery in the Division of Plastic Surgery at the University of Massachusetts.
Fascinated by eyelid surgery and its complex anatomy and physiology, Dr. Sarraga then pursued a fellowship in Ophthalmic Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery with Dr. Pascale Perusse, a prominent surgeon with over 25 years of experience and an expert in the field. During this fellowship, he learned about the intricacies of oculoplastic surgery and rejuvenation of the upper face (eyelids, cheeks, brow).
Dr. Sarraga joined Dr. Storch in practice at the beginning of July 2012 here in sunny South Florida. He has been extensively mentored by Dr. Storch in Face, Neck and Rhinoplasty Cosmetic Surgery. He is very passionate about his work and strives to do exceptional work that will help his each patients improve their appearance and even, perhaps, the quality of their life. He regularly performs oculoplastic, facial rejuvenation (surgery of the face, neck and eyes), Rhinoplasty and cosmetic and reconstructive breast surgery. He is also a Ophthalmic Plastic Surgery consultant for various Ophthalmology practices from Miami to Fort Lauderdale and Weston. He is an active member of the prestigious American Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (ASAPS), the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) and the Southeastern Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons (SESPRS).",23 km,False,False,0

As a board certified Otolaryngologist, I have the perfect background for a complete understanding of the functional and aesthetic components of the nose - and the surgical skills to optimize them. I've been on a career pursuit to master the art of the most difficult of all plastic surgeries - rhinoplasty! Having found the current US rhinoplasty surgical knowledgebase (and results) insufficient, I've travelled across the world in search of the very best techniques. I've then created my own unique blend of the very best and most precise methods to achieve high end rhinoplasty results, with my own personal aesthetic discerning eye as a guide. I have a deep desire to help you achieve the nose of your dreams and relentless seek the absolute best possible outcome in every case I perform. I have unprecedented experience in all skin types and ethnicities - something that allows me unique insight to be able to dial in the exact best shape for each patient and their anatomy. I also dedicate at least 50% of my practice to revision rhinoplasty - again allowing insight to be able to not only understand how to correct other surgeon's mistakes, but to prevent these problems from occuring in the first place in my own cases.
