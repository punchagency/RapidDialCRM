Hello! I need you to implement the Smart Calling & Route Optimization Algorithm for our QuantumPunch platform.

CRITICAL: Read this complete instruction file first:
/home/claude/REPLIT_INSTRUCTIONS.md

This file contains all the code, setup instructions, and implementation phases you need.

CONTEXT:
We're building a system that helps distributed calling teams (Nigeria/Pakistan) coordinate with field sales reps (Miami, DC) to optimize appointment booking. The algorithm:
- Prioritizes prospects geographically
- Clusters appointments for efficient routing
- Integrates with Google Calendar
- Uses HERE Maps API for drive time calculations

IMPLEMENTATION PHASES (execute in this exact order):

PHASE 1: Project Setup
- Create directory structure: src/{services,routes,models,utils,jobs}, tests/{unit,integration}, scripts
- Run: npm init -y
- Install all dependencies listed in Step 1.3 of the instruction file
- Create .env file with the template provided

PHASE 2: Database Setup
- Create src/config/database.js (code provided in instructions)
- Create scripts/setup-database.sql (complete SQL schema provided)
- Create scripts/run-db-setup.js (code provided)
- Execute: node scripts/run-db-setup.js

PHASE 3: Core Services
Create these files with the complete code from the instruction file:
- src/services/geocoding.service.js
- src/services/routing.service.js
- src/services/priority.service.js
- src/services/calendar.service.js
- src/services/cache.service.js

PHASE 4: Algorithm Services
Create these files:
- src/services/coldstart.service.js
- src/services/clustering.service.js
- src/services/algorithm.service.js

PHASE 5: API Routes
Create these files:
- src/routes/calling.routes.js
- src/routes/appointments.routes.js

PHASE 6: Main Application
- Create src/app.js (complete code provided)

PHASE 7: Data Scripts
Create these files:
- scripts/geocode-prospects.js
- scripts/init-field-reps.js

PHASE 8: Package.json Scripts
Add the scripts section from the instructions to package.json

AFTER IMPLEMENTATION:
Run in this order:
1. npm run setup-db
2. npm run init-reps
3. npm start (or npm run dev for development)

IMPORTANT CONFIGURATION:
- DC Field Rep home ZIP code: 22101
- Miami Field Rep home ZIP: TBD (leave configurable)
- Work hours: 9am-5pm EST
- Visit duration: 45 minutes
- Max visits per day: 3-4

TESTING ENDPOINTS:
After implementation, verify these work:
- GET http://localhost:3000/health
- GET http://localhost:3000/api/calling-list/dc
- POST http://localhost:3000/api/appointments/booking-options

Please start with Phase 1 and proceed through all phases. Confirm completion of each phase before moving to the next. Let me know if you encounter any issues or need clarification.
